## How to Assign an Issue to Yourself

1. Navigate to the **Issues** tab in the GitHub repository.
2. Browse through available issues or create a new one if necessary.
3. Choose an issue you'd like to work on and click on it to open the details.
4. Comment on the issue mentioning that you'd like to handle it.
5. If the maintainers approve, they might assign the issue to you officially.

## Working on a New Feature Branch

1. Ensure you have the latest changes from the `main` branch:
    - git checkout main
    - git pull origin main
2. Create a new branch for your feature:
    - git checkout -b your-initials-feature-name
    - Replace `feature-name` with a descriptive name for your feature.
        - ex: git checkout -b ar-header-navigation
3. Make changes, write code, and commit your work:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Description of changes made"

## Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. Push your feature branch to the remote repository:
    - git push origin feature-name

## Initiating a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub and switch to your feature branch.
2. Click on the "New pull request" button.
3. Compare changes between your feature branch and the `main` branch.
4. Fill in details about your changes in the pull request template.
5. Submit the pull request.

## Peer Code Review

1. Share the link to your pull request with your peers or team members.
2. Ask for their review and feedback on the changes.
3. Peers can add comments, suggestions, or approve the pull request.
4. Address any feedback or comments and make necessary changes in your branch.
5. Once approved, a maintainer can merge your pull request into the `main` branch.

Remember to communicate effectively, follow project guidelines, and be open to feedback during the entire process.

Happy contributing!
